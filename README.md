## Requirements

* [Python 3.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (3.6 should suffice but untested)

  1. Pull down the source code to your local machine and navigate to the project folder.
  
  ```
  Example:

  ```
  
  2. To run, simply pass the warehouseLoadLambdaFunction.py program as an argument to the Python interpreter.
